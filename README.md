<h2> LIS 160 PROJECT </h2>
<h3> Building Web Applications in Django </h3>

This web application serves as a requirement for my LIS 160 class, designed to deepen our understanding of the various components of web development and to apply the knowledge we gained from the DataCamp courses we completed.

<h2>LyricsPeriod</h2>
LyricsPeriod is a web application that contains all the praise and worship songs we use during Sunday services at church. The goal is to easily find the songs we have used before and record new songs each time. 
<br/>Being able to edit the paragraph spaces of the song lyrics is helpful in the FreeShow software.  
  - It produces slide presentations based on the lyrics you paste. It uses paragraph spaces to determine if the lyrics should be moved to the next slide.
